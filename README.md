# CousinWare
What's CousinWare? It's the client I've been working on for about 9 month
CousinWare was a client made for my friends but seeing as how Im leaving the community and already have thought I'd post this

Is this a rat? No why would I do that I'm leaving but if you don't belive me you have commit history for the past 9 months

Is this client the leaked private client that will change pvp for history? No but there are some unique things so please take a look around
Personally mine is the block placements I've added being able to bypass most strict ncp servers and work more than any other client on oldfag a really strict server
Okay sorry about bragging about the placements

Is this client going to be updated? Kinda when I'm really bored I might open up IntelliJ to mess with something's if I do I'll push the changes.

If the server does update to 1.16 I've posted my 1.16 port which is missing a lot of stuff but you can continue off of that if anyone chooses
